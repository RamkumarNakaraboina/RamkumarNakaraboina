## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- KBC game using Python(https://github.com/RamkumarNakaraboina/KBC-GAME-Project): Feel free to explore my repositories for more! This is a console-based implementation of the famous "Kaun Banega Crorepati" game using Python. The game features a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty. Players start with easy questions and can win virtual money as they progress. Each correct answer earns them more money, but the questions become progressively harder.
